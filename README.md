Simple tetris game you can use as a school project, hardest part was the rotation of shapes  
please check my solution for rotation and let me know how to improve it 
1. you can pause the game 
2. you can increase or decrease the speed of the game 
I tried to comment the code as much as i can, if you need more clarifications please do not hesitate to contact me at idriss.el.moussaouiti@gmail.com
